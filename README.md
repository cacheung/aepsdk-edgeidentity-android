#### Code Format

This project uses the code formatting tools [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint). Formatting is applied when the project is built from Gradle and is checked when changes are submitted to the CI build system.

Prettier requires [Node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) 10+
